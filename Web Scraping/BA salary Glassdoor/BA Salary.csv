Job Summary
UBC has embarked on a multi-year journey to transform its academic and administrative support processes and system environments for the entire UBC community. In November 2020, UBC successfully went live with its new HR and Finance implementation of Workday as part of Release 1. The Integrated Renewal Program (IRP) is now focused on the journey to renew the Student information ecosystem, anchored by the implementation of Workday Student.
In 2021, as part of IRP Release 1, UBC PRiSM and CISO teams performed a risk assessment which concluded with recommendations on how to increase adherence to UBC’s Information Security Standards for Workday-related projects. The outcome was initialization of the Security Threat Risk Assessment (STRA) project whose main objective is to design, build and test an enhanced logging and monitoring system which would, in turn, help identify, report, and mitigate security risks.
The Senior Business Systems Analyst for STRA will lead the analysis, design, build and test of proposed system features and its related procedures.
Initially the Business Systems Analyst II will lead the assessment of client needs in an effort to align business initiatives with information technology solutions.

Consequence of Error/Judgement


The BDA is a representative of ES and liaises with ES staff and various members of the university community including UBC IT, faculties and service units. This is a highly visible position, which has continuous contact with Enrolment Services staff and a very diverse university and public community. Projects coordinated by the incumbent will directly impact faculty, staff and student relationships with UBC and the outside community.

Failure to adequately involve stakeholders could result in ineffective design of reports to support business operations or the ineffective use of available reports resulting in unnecessary work by faculty, staff and administrators. The success of these projects directly impacts the recruitment, retention, and administration of students at both UBCV and UBCO and service delivery levels by faculty, staff and administrators. A thorough understanding pertaining to privacy legislation, policies and data security is required to adequately ensure the appropriate levels of security are met. Unless adequate management and monitoring take place, the integrity of the security of the SIS and student records would be jeopardized resulting in non-compliance and negative legal and reputational consequences for the University.

This position also carries responsibility for facilitating the testing of new and existing reports. A thorough understanding of the Student Information System s complex data structure and definitions are required to adequately identify possible problems. Unless adequate testing takes place, problems can occur once in production, again reflecting negatively on Enrolment Services and, ultimately, the University s customers and clients.

About the job
On October 6, 2021, the Government of Canada announced details of its plans to require vaccination across the federal public service. As a separate and large federal employer, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) supports and will follow this new policy direction.
As of November 8, 2021, all employees of the CRA, including new hires, are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 unless accommodated based on a medical contraindication, religion, or another prohibited ground for discrimination as defined under the Canadian Human Rights Act and attest to their vaccination status.
The requirement to be fully vaccinated applies to all employees and new hires, whether they are teleworking, working remotely or working on-site. This condition of employment applies to indeterminate (permanent), determinate (term), and student hiring. Should you reach the point in the staffing process where it is necessary to verify conditions of employment, there will be a requirement to complete an attestation of vaccination status.
CRA prioritizes diversity and inclusion and is firmly committed to providing a diverse workforce that reflects the population we serve. CRA’s National Employment Equity (EE) Staffing Strategy strives to eliminate EE gaps for the four EE designated groups: Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, and women.
